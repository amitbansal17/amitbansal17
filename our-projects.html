According to the FDA, over 4.5 billion prescriptions were filled,
and Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) caused over 106,000 deaths and
hospitalized over 2M people in 2017 in the US alone.
In developing countries, where prescription drugs are available over
the counter, the death rates due to ADRs are even higher.
In India, for example, 52% of the population admits to self-medicating
prescription drugs in order to save doctor consultancy costs.
That’s nearly 690M people in India who are at risk of ADR.</p></div><div class="image-container"><img src="images/b3f294fb955879b8552b5bfa0217b45a.jpg" alt="Pills"></div></div></article><article class="content-block bg-stat"><div class="op-time-stats"><div class="title">The average length of medical primary care consultants spend with

a great proliferation of smartphone users. There are nearly 2.4B smartphone users with
Internet access around the world and the number is expected to surpass 5B by 2020.
This has led to a surge in online options to get the needed health care.
Although these methods are cheaper and more easily accessible, the providers often do not have
the full information on patients and treatment may lead to more potential risks.
The Ok to Take app is going to turn these things around and protect patients from ADRs.</p><div class="stats"><div class="stat-title">Number of doctors per 1000 patients:</div><div class="bar green"></div><div class="stat-num"><div class="number">3-7 / 1000</div><div class="target">First world countries</div></div><div class="bar red"></div><div class="stat-num"><div class="number">0.01-0.09 / 1000</div><div class="target">Developing countries</div></div></div></div></article><article class="content-block bg-outline"><div class="op-how-helps"><div class="image-container"><img src="images/b159d460bb530bbfbf71cb923ae9cfae.jpg" alt="How it will help me"></div><div class="text-container"><h2 class="block-title">How it will help me</h2><p class="text">Available 24/7 at your fingertips, using innovative drug recognition technology,
an extensive database and a user-friendly interface, the OK to Take app allows
you keep an up-to-date list of your current medications and allergies and answer
basic drug interaction questions, e.g.: Is this new drug safe to take with my current medications?
Will I have an allergic reaction to this medication? The app can warn you about a potentially
harmful drug interaction, and notify you when it’s important to contact your doctor, thus protecting your health.
</p></div></div></article><article class="content-block"><div class="op-add"><h2 class="block-title">Add drugs to check interaction</h2><p class="text">The OK to Take app is extremely easy to use. A list of medications is created by adding them to the app either
by taking a picture of the blister pack or by typing in the drug’s name. A quick check to see if any on
the current or newly added medications can cause any harm be done by touch of a button.</p><img src="images/b62750d9c2120efbc4587d179ccbe4eb.png" alt="Application screens"></div></article><article class="op-risks content-block bg-outline"><div class="text-container"><h2 class="block-title">See your risks</h2><p class="text">The OK to Take app checks for potentially dangerous interactions among a group of medications.
Interactions will be classified into three risk types, high, medium and low.
It is recommended that you stop taking a medication that leads to a high risk interaction and consult the prescribing health care provider.
For medium and low risks, it is likely safe to take the medications but it’s best to read
the prescribing information that accompanies the drug and/or discuss with your healthcare provider. Take your health seriously.</p></div><div class="image-container"><img class="phones" src="images/d70a50a61ce2d81932ec785ac4225738.png" alt="See risks"></div></article><article class="content-block"><div class="op-reports"><div class="image-container"><img src="images/d70a50a61ce2d81932ec785ac4225738.png" alt="Create &amp; Share Reports"></div><div class="text-container"><h2 class="block-title">Create & Share Reports</h2><p class="text">The app creates medication reports that you can share with others.
Reports that list current and/or past medications, along with drug allergies, can provide a clearer picture of your health to a doctor,
who can then make safe prescribing recommendations. This app will generate the report that can be downloaded to your smartphone and/or
sent directly to a health care provider or family member.
