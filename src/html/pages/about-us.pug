                    Using advanced algorithms, data science, and artificial-intelligence capability, we have developed a product that was inconceivable only a few years ago.  It is a software-as-a-service digital platform for use as a personal health diary.  It receives, stores, and updates all of a patient's medical information, making it available to anyone the patient wishes -- doctors, family members, and caregivers.  It facilitates telehealth as well as communication among a patient's health providers.  It is easy to use in any language.  It improves health outcomes.

                    span Diya is a word of Arabic origin that means "radiance."  It has been adopted by South-Asian culture as a name for a primitive lamp -- a small handmade clay bowl that, with a bit of oil and a wick, creates light.  It symbolizes optimism and prosperity, lighting the dark to give a sense of calm.

                    span.
                        In selecting our name, we drew inspiration from a sentence in the prayer of St. Francis of Assisi:  "Where there is darkness, may I bring light."  When it comes to our health care, there is an enormous amount of darkness -- information darkness.  Doctors, patients, and families often are in the dark.  Our product offers lifesaving information delivered on a computer or smartphone, a unique and sophisticated gift of modern technology.  Yet to us it also is a simple gift -- it lights the dark.

                        “medical alert bracelet.”  It allows for remote referrals, monitoring of symptoms, alerts about medications
                        (e.g., dosage duplications or contraindications), among other capabilities. Most importantly, the information is controlled by,
                        owned by, and travels with the patient, regardless of changes in doctor, medical plan, residence, or caregiver.
