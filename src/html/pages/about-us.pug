            p.text.
                We are a group of socially-minded individuals 
                from a spectrum of developed and developing
                countries around the world. We represent many
                different cultures, religions, ethnic background,
                and speak over a dozen spoken languages.
                Some of us are starting to dabble in the world of
                social causes, while others have generations of social
                work in our lineage. We have deep expertise in
                the areas of technical, medical, legal, arts
                and linguistics, and at DiyaHealth, we share a common cause
                to help make life saving healthcare decisions feasible for all.

                    p.text.
                        Much of the world's population lives in rural or undeveloped
                        areas where basic life needs cannot be met.
                        Yet, they still develop health ailments requiring medical treatment.
                        They may have to travel miles to find this help, however communication
                        can be limited to nil. Making health care decisions based on limited
                        information is not desirable; in reality, itâ€™s unsafe.

                        The primary mission of DiyaHealth is to build technology 
                        o bridge the gap of access to basic health care information
                        for underprivileged population, in order to assist them to make safer health care decisions.

                    The diya is a traditional oil lamp usually made from clay.
                    It is truly a great symbol of optimism and prosperity.
                    It lights the dark and gives a deep sense of calm, which is extremely in tune with our mission.
                    Similar to the diya we want to light the path for those who have lost in the dark
                    and give them the hope for a better and healthier future.
