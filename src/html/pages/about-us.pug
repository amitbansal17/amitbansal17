                    p.text.
                        Much of the world's population lives in rural or undeveloped
                        areas where basic life needs cannot be met.
                        Yet, they still develop health ailments requiring medical treatment.
                        They may have to travel miles to find this help, however communication
                        can be limited to nil. Making health care decisions based on limited
                        information is not desirable; in reality, itâ€™s unsafe.

                        for underprivileged population, in order to assist them to make safer health care decisions.

                    The diya is a traditional oil lamp usually made from clay.
                    It is truly a great symbol of optimism and prosperity.
                    It lights the dark and gives a deep sense of calm, which is extremely in tune with our mission.
                    Similar to the diya we want to light the path for those who have lost in the dark
                    and give them the hope for a better and healthier future.
