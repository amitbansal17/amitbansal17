                p.text.
                    We are a group of socially-minded individuals 
                    from a spectrum of developed and developing
                    countries around the world. We represent many
                    different cultures, religions, ethnic background,
                    and speak over a dozen spoken languages.
                    Some of us are starting to dabble in the world of
                    social causes, while others have generations of social
                    work in our lineage. We have deep expertise in
                    the areas of technical, medical, legal, arts
                    and linguistics, and at DiyaGroup, we share a common cause
                    to help make life saving healthcare decisions feasible for all.

                    The diya is a traditional oil lamp usually made from clay.
                    It is used in India for special occasions, specifically during the Diwali Festival,
                    the Festival of Lights. The diya is truly a great symbol of optimism and prosperity.
                    It lights the dark and gives a deep sense of calm, which is extremely in tune with our mission.
                    Similar to the diya we want to light the path for those who have lost in the dark
                    and give them the hope for a better and healthier future.

                p.text.
                    Much of the world's population lives in rural or undeveloped
                    areas where basic life needs cannot be met.
                    Yet, they still develop health ailments requiring medical treatment.
                    They may have to travel miles to find this help, however communication
                    can be limited to nil. Making health care decisions based on limited
                    information is not desirable; in reality, itâ€™s unsafe.
