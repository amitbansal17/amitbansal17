        p.text.paragraph Diya Health allows physicians to do remote follow ups of vital signs like blood pressure & blood sugars with billable codes for up to 4 times per month per patient.
        p.text.paragraph Due to COVID-19*, physicians or allied health professionals (NPs, PAs) are allowed to increase practice revenue from Virtual Check-ins (G2014 & G2012), e-Consults (93446-99451) and Online Digital Evaluations (G2061-2063) up to 4 times per month per patient. These services are quickly rendered and automatically tracked for reimbursement in Diya. Contact us to learn how!
        p.text.paragraph We know that during this unprecedented time, physician incomes have dropped drastically and our simple workflow will allow for businesses to regain some of their vital income ASAP.
